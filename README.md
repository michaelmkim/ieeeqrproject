UIUC-iEEE-QR-Project
====================

Project done by the iEEE UIUC branch.

The goal is to program a fully automated quadrotor.

Right now, the project is divided into two main teams: Image Processing (IP) and Machine AI (MAI).

IP will work on the machine's depth perception using information from cameras placed around the room and the onboard camera.

MAI will work on the algortihms that will guide the machine around the room without collision.
